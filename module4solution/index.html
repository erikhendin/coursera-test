  <h1>Module 4 Assignment - Erik Hendin</h1>
<h3>Assignment:</h3>
<h4>(See Console Log for output)</h4>
<p>loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.</p>
<p>
However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned in this module, your job will be to fix the code in those libraries.</p>
